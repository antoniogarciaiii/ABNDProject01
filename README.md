![Alt text](http://coshimel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ABNd_01_screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Project Overview
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.
## Requirements
Your design must include:
* Business name
* At least one photo representing the business
* Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
* Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
* Address of the Business
* Description of business
* Hours of operation
## Design notes:
*  After having learned how to do some layouts using straight XML, I wanted to see what it was like to use the 'Design' tab. I took care of most of the final details using the 'Text' tab. This also explains why the ''textAppearance' property for some of the TextViews uses some built-in styles, such as the one for 'Subhead,' as opposed to me manually specifying SP for fonts. I'm also aware I could have gone the way of modifying the styles.xml file, but once again, I wanted to try something different.
*  I have been associated with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights for about seven years, and have recently worked with some other volunteers to make a web app for them. Perhaps we can make a native app for them one day. Until then, I have been given consent to practice using their information.
*  By nature of it being an immigrant-serving organization, I made sure to also have it in (US) Spanish. Once I get more comfortable, I'll add in translations for Arabic, Mandarin, Polish, and Tagalog.
## Tested on:
*  Motorola XT1575 (Android 7.0, API 24)
*  AVD: Nexus 4 API 27
